It is one of two polytechnic universities in the California State University system. Cal Poly Pomona began as the southern campus of the California Polytechnic School (today known as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) in 1938 when the Voorhis School for Boys and its adjacent farm in the city of San Dimas were donated by Charles Voorhis and his son Jerry Voorhis. Cal Poly's southern campus grew further in 1949 when it acquired the University of California, W.K. Kellogg Institute of Animal Husbandry from the University of California. UC's W.K. Kellogg Institute of Animal Husbandry was located in the neighboring city of Pomona, California and had previously belonged to Will Keith Kellogg. Cal Poly Pomona, then known as Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis, and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo continued operations under a unified administrative control until they became independent from one another in 1966. Cal Poly Pomona currently offers bachelor's degrees in 94 majors, 39 master's degrees, 13 teaching credentials and a doctorate across 9 distinct academic colleges.[11][12][13] The university is one among a small group of polytechnic universities in the United States which tend to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences. Its sports teams are known as the Cal Poly Pomona Broncos and play in the NCAA Division II as part of the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). The Broncos sponsor 10 varsity sports and have won 14 NCAA national championships. Current and former Cal Poly Pomona athletes have won 7 Olympic medals (3 gold, 1 silver, and 3 bronze).[14] Past and present faculty and alumni include two Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, two Academy Award winners, two Olympic medalists, two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, a U.S. Secretary of Labor, a Pritzker Prize laureate, a Heisman Trophy winner, a member of the National Academies and an Emmy Award winner.

Myron Angel, founder of the California Polytechnic School, San Luis Obispo, CA. January 7, 1899.[15][16] Cal Poly at Pomona stands on the former Arabian horse ranch of cereal magnate W.K. Kellogg. Events leading to the foundation of present-day Cal Poly at Pomona began with the ending of the Voorhis School for Boys near Walnut Creek[17] in San Dimas, California and its acquisition by the San Luis Obispo-based California Polytechnic School in 1938.[18][19] The California Polytechnic School was founded as a vocational high school when California Governor Henry Gage signed the Polytechnic School Bill on March 8, 1901 after its drafting by school founder Myron Angel.[20] Voorhis School, on the other hand, had been established in 1928 as a private vocational school which provided elementary schooling for underprivileged boys and operated under the Christian religious principle, "education coupled with the Kingdom of God".[21][19] Its founder Charles B. Voorhis and headmaster Jerry Voorhis maintained the school opened throughout the worst years of the Great Depression but persistent economic pressures forced them to transfer control to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1938.[22][19] Voorhis School became the Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit and its educational offerings were raised to the same level as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's, then a two-year college.[23] The horticulture program was moved to the new satellite campus and the two units operated as one institution spanning two locations under the leadership of president Julian McPhee.[24] Aerial view of campus During World War II most of the student body was called to active military duty; enrollment declined and the campus closed in 1943.[24][25] Reopening after the war, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit operated in San Dimas until 1956 when it moved to Will Keith Kellogg’s former horse ranch in the neighboring city of Pomona, California.[26] Acknowledging its Kellogg legacy, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit changed its name to Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit and offered six programs in agriculture.[26] The inaugural class of 1957 at the new campus consisted of 57 students graduating with bachelor’s degrees in a ceremony held at the Rose Garden in Pomona and religious services at Voorhis Chapel in San Dimas.[27][28] Also in 1957, Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis introduced the College of Engineering, the second academic unit after the College of Agriculture.[29] The California Master Plan for Higher Education added the two Cal Poly campuses to the new California State College system in 1961 and Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit opened its doors for the first time to 329 female students.[26] President McPhee retired in 1966, and Cal Poly split into two different and independent universities. The partnership between the two campuses remains with their involvement in the annual Cal Poly Universities Rose Float.[23][30] To better reflect its new ties to the California State College system, Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis changed its name to "California State Polytechnic College, Kellogg-Voorhis" in 1966 and became the 16th campus to officially join the CSC system.[26] Robert C. Kramer assumed presidency of the independent campus in 1966 (second overall as the university recognizes McPhee as its first) and California State Polytechnic College, Kellogg-Voorhis finally adopted its present-day name California State Polytechnic University, Pomona on June 1, 1972.[31][32] In 1998, Cal Poly Pomona received criticism when it planned to grant an honorary degree to Robert Mugabe. Mugabe's negative humanitarian record as president of Zimbabwe lead to protests from staff, faculty and students, ultimately forcing the university to rescind the award.[33] Cal Poly Pomona underwent further growth in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the construction of the CLA Building (slated for demolition),[34][35] academic facilities, expansion to the Cal Poly Pomona University Library and the addition of programs such as the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies, the I-Poly High School and the U.R. Bronco undergraduate research program. Under then-president J. Michael Ortiz, Cal Poly Pomona launched its first comprehensive capital campaign in fall of 2008 to increase its permanent endowment. Nevertheless, the negative economic effects caused by the late-2000s recession has increased student fees, reduced enrollment availability, eliminated two athletic programs and introduced a mandatory furlough calendar for most of its employees.[36][37][38][39] Name[edit] See also: Campus naming conventions in the CSU and California Polytechnic State University#Name. The campus office of public affairs recognizes two official names for the university: "California State Polytechnic University, Pomona" and "Cal Poly Pomona".[40] However, "Cal Poly" has also been used to refer to Cal Poly at Pomona, as both itself and California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, California were one institution spanning two locations from 1938 to 1966.[41] Cal Poly's office of public affairs recommends not to abbreviate the university's name merely as "Cal Poly".[40] In the years when the University of California was in charge of Kellogg's donated estate in Pomona (1932–1943), the names "University of California, W.K. Kellogg Institute" and "W.K. Kellogg Institute of Animal Husbandry University of California, Pomona", came into use to describe the site.[42][43] Although Cal Poly Pomona is now part of the California State University, its naming convention does not follow that of most campuses within the system (for example, the CSU campus in San Diego bears the full official name "San Diego State University" and the CSU campus in Fullerton uses the name "California State University, Fullerton").[44][45] "Pomona State University" and "California State University, Pomona" are seldom used and are not in the university's graphic standard's manual.[40] Former seals and logos[edit] Former seal used by the university during the University of California years (1932-1943). Former seal used by the university from the mid-1980s to the summer of 2018 Campus[edit] Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Los Angeles Cal Poly Pomona is located about 30 miles east of Downtown Los Angeles.[46] Cal Poly Pomona is situated in Pomona, a largely suburban city that is part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The city of Pomona is located in the eastern portion of Los Angeles County and borders the neighboring county of San Bernardino to the east. The university's 1,725 acres (698 ha) campus[47] make it the second largest in the California State University system,[48] a figure which includes various facilities scattered throughout Southern California such as a 53-acre (21 ha) ranch in Santa Paula, California, 25-acre (10 ha) campus at the former Spadra Landfill (now known as "Spadra Ranch"),[49][50] and the Neutra VDL Studio and Residences in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. The university is currently negotiating the transfer of the 302 acre Lanterman Developmental Center from the State of California. The land is to be used for academic purposes and expansion of the Innovation Village and also shared by the California Highway Patrol, the California Air Resources Board and the California Conservation Corps. The transfer of the land is part of the Governor's 2015-2016 Proposed Budget.[51] Old horse stables Although part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the university is in close proximity to two other large metropolitan and culturally-defined regions, the Inland Empire and Orange County.[52] The university has a tier 1 area, defined as a geographical admissions region surrounding the campus, roughly bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains to the north, the city of Chino Hills to the south, Interstate 605 to the west, and Interstate 15 to the east.[53] Cal Poly Pomona's campus buildings vary in age and style from the Mission Revival Kellogg Horse Stables and the Kellogg House (suggesting the Spanish colonial architectural heritage of Southern California) built in the 1920s; the modernist box-like portion of the library completed in 1969; to contemporary dormitories, engineering, science and library-expansion facilities completed in the early 21st century.[54] Leisure and recreational locations include a rose garden which dates back to the Kellogg horse ranch years; the Kellogg House designed by Los Angeles-based architects Charles Gibbs Adams, Myron Hunt and Harold Coulson Chambers in the 1920s; and a 1.3 acres (0.53 ha) Japanese garden built in 2003 and designed by Takeo Uesugi.[55][56] Kellogg's House features grounds which were initially landscaped by Charles Gibbs Adams but were later completed by Florence Yoch & Lucile Council.[55] Cal Poly Pomona's George and Sakaye Aratani Japanese Garden is one among three under management by institutions of higher education in the County of Los Angeles, the others being the Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden at Cal State Long Beach, and the Shinwa-En Garden at Cal State Dominguez Hills.[57] At the center of the campus and atop Horsehill are the buildings of the Collins College of Hospitality Management and Kellogg West, a hotel and conference center and home of the student/faculty-run Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch. At the northwest part of the campus is the Voorhis Ecological Reserve, which serves as a 31 hectares (77 acres) wildlife corridor containing Coastal Sage Scrub and Coast Live Oak trees among others.[58] Contrasting some of these architecturally prominent facilities, there are various portable buildings on campus which are used to accommodate the growing enrollment of recent decades. Cal Poly Pomona operates the International Polytechnic High School, a college preparatory high school located on campus. The letters "CPP" made of concrete are located on Colt Hill overlooking the campus. The letters "CP" were initially added in 1959, with the second "P" added in 2004 to distinguish it from the Cal Poly campus in San Luis Obispo.[59] Cal Poly Pomona's dominant landmark is a futurist-styled administrative facility known as the CLA Building which was designed by Antoine Predock and opened in 1993. The building's peculiar shape (standing out by a triangular-shaped "skyroom" atop its eight-story tower[60]) has become a symbol of the university; in addition, its close location to film studios based in the Hollywood borough of Los Angeles have prompted its inclusion in motion pictures such as Gattaca and Impostor.[61] In 2013, the California State University Board of Trustees voted to demolish the building and replace it with a new academic/faculty complex because of severe seismic risks.[34] Cal Poly Pomona's new South Campus Noted modernist architect James Pulliam once served as campus architect and instructor and designed the Bookstore, W. Keith and Janet Kellogg Art Gallery, Interim Design Center (IDC) and Student Union building which architectural historian David Gebhard regarded as the best building on campus.[62] Academic and research facilities[edit] The W. K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center is an academic and research facility serving one of the 22 terms and conditions to the donation of the Kellogg ranch by maintaining Kellogg's purebred Arabian horses and their breeding program. Another academic facility highlighting the Kellogg legacy is the Horse Stables (also known as University Plaza) which contains a small research library specializing in equine studies along with offices for student services and various campus organizations. Cal Poly Pomona's Voorhis Ecological Reserve Conceived in 1995 by then university president, Bob H. Suzuki, and initially financed by NASA and the Economic Development Administration, the Innovation Village is a 65-acre (26 ha) public/private partnership research and business facility at the southern edge of the campus. Major tenants include the American Red Cross, Southern California Edison, and the NASA Commercialization Center.[63] The project is currently at the halfway mark of building and leasing 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of the projected total building space. Once complete, it is estimated that the project would employ 2000 to 3000 people and provide half a billion dollars of economic benefits to the local, regional and state economies.[64] Campus sustainability and transportation[edit] The main quad at Cal Poly Pomona The university has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus. In November 2007, Cal Poly Pomona became a signatory member of the American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment.[65] Among other things, this committed the university to ensure that within one year, it would purchase or produce at least 15% of the institution's electric consumption from renewable sources. The university, along with other members in the CSU, is also a member of the California Climate Action Registry.[66] and lists on The Princeton Review's Guide to 375 Green Colleges.[67] As a part of the campus' Climate Action Plan to reduce its carbon footprint, the campus offers incentive parking for students and faculty participating in its Rideshare program.[68] The carpooling initiative gives users the opportunity to park in reserved spaces located closer to campus buildings.[69] Cal Poly Pomona's institute for sustainability education is the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies. The center was built adjacent to an old landfill and conducts research in the areas of sustainable technology and agriculture. As an example of Cradle to Cradle Design, it uses solar-powered dormitories, aquaculture ponds, and organic gardens while providing an environmentally-sustainable housing accommodation for 22 graduate students. In 2010, with the installation of a 210,000 kW hours CPV system by Amonix, the center became the first carbon neutral facility in the California State University system.[70] The center is part of Agriscapes, a 40-acre (16 ha) research project that showcases environmental and agricultural sustainable practices including methods to grow food, conserve water and energy and recycle urban waste. Agriscapes is home of the Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch which sells locally and campus grown foods and products. Cal Poly Pomona campus also contains a rainforest greenhouse, a California ethnobotany garden, and an aquatic biology center collectively known as BioTrek, which provides environmental education to all academic levels.[71] The entire campus community is served by a free campus shuttle system known as "Bronco Express". The shuttle system has 3 lines and is run by the office of Transportation Services.[72] In addition, PTS also offers a shuttle service known as "Metrolink" which provides both students and faculty a direct connection from the Pomona North and Downtown Pomona Metrolink stations to the CLA Building.[72] Foothill Transit lines 190, 194, 195, 289, 480, 482, and 486 serve the campus daily. Seismic risks and other challenges of campus development[edit] Although it's believed that the San Jose Fault runs through campus, and geotechnical investigations have been conducted, there is uncertainty regarding its precise type and location. The CLA Building suffers from structural flaws, most notably, water intrusion. In 2005, the university filed a lawsuit against a contractor, for which it was compensated $13.3 million in an out-of-court settlement.[73] Amid these concerns, in September 2010, the CSU Board of Trustees approved a proposal to have the building razed.[74] Hideo Sasaki's architectural firm Sasaki Associates, Inc. found in the February 2010 master plan that the campus's seismic risk, uneven terrain, lack of parking spaces, small classrooms, and pedestrian-unfriendly roads are major constraints for future campus development. It also indicated the lack of identity, an undefined sense of arrival, and a desire to build a stronger on-campus community, among others, as recurrent themes among campus's users. Nonetheless, the firm highlights campus ethnic diversity, its location-climate, and the natural beauty of campus, among others, as positive aspects of the physical campus as well as the campus life experience.[75] Organization and administration[edit] College founding College Year founded Agriculture 1938[76] Business Administration 1968[77] Education and Integrative Studies 1973[78] Engineering 1957[29] Environmental Design 1970[79] Hospitality Management (Collins) 1973[80] Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences Science Cal Poly at Pomona is one of two polytechnics[81] in the 23-member California State University system.[82] The CSU system is governed by a 25-member board of trustees, including one faculty trustee, one alumni trustee, and two student trustees, and has authority over curricular development, campus planning, and fiscal management.[83][84] The university system is currently governed by Chancellor Joseph I. Castro, who assumed the office in 2020.[85] The chief executive of the Cal Poly Pomona campus is President Soraya M. Coley.[86] Cal Poly Pomona is a member of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU)[87] University Educational Trust (UET)[edit] The University Educational Trust (UET) was a 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt organization serving as a source of external fund-raising, funds-management and revenue-distribution at Cal Poly Pomona.[88] According to meeting minutes from 2011, the "Cal Poly Pomona University Educational Trust (UET) Board of Directors, the Chancellor's Office and University Administration made the decision to dissolve the UET and transfer all of its net assets to the Cal Poly Pomona Foundation, Inc."[89] Endowment[edit] Cal Poly Pomona financial endowment was valued at $85.6 million as of 30 June 2016[update].[90] In fall 2010, Cal Poly Pomona embarked on its first comprehensive fundraising campaign.[91] Early major donors helped raise more than half of the campaign's goal of $150 million before its formal launch. They included an anonymous benefactor who pledged $12 million,[92] and $2 million from 1980 alumni Mickey and Lee Segal.[93] Just before the campaign launch, on July 26, 2010, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation awarded a $42 million challenge grant to the university to increase educational access to underrepresented communities, making it the largest cash gift in the history of the CSU system.[94][95] On February 28, 2011, Panda Express founders Andrew and Peggy Cherng announced a $2.5 million pledge to Cal Poly Pomona's Collins College of Hospitality Management.[96] The university expects that its permanent endowment at the conclusion of its first comprehensive campaign will top $100 million.[97] On June 15, 2021, philanthropist MacKenzie Scott made a $40 million cash gift to Cal Poly Pomona, making it the largest donation or grant to Cal Poly Pomona given by an individual.[98] Academics[edit] Main article: Cal Poly Pomona academics Main entrance of the Cal Poly Pomona University Library Cal Poly Pomona's academic offerings have evolved throughout the years. Prior to the ownership shift to Cal Poly SLO in 1938, the Voorhis School for Boys in San Dimas had been providing educational offerings in "music, bookkeeping, agriculture, library work, carpentry, nature study, machine shop, and printing" coupled with Christian religious fundamentals to an all-male student body with poor, underage boys.[21][99] In 1938, the campus became the agricultural branch of Cal Poly SLO when a small staff was transfer from San Luis Obispo along with group of agricultural inspection students.[100] Thus, Cal Poly at Pomona (then just Cal Poly) began offering Associate's degrees in 1938 and Bachelor's degrees in 1940 when, despite legislative opposition from pro-University of California members in Sacramento, president Julian McPhee asked allied members Armistead B. Carter and Daniel C. Murphy to introduce the bill when two opposing members were not present to vote.[101] Following the governance breakup with the San Luis Obispo in 1966, and as outlined by the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education, Cal Poly Pomona continued "offer[ing] undergraduate and graduate instruction through the master's degree in the liberal arts and sciences and professional education, including teacher education."[102] Currently, Cal Poly Pomona promotes a "learn by doing" philosophy, where an essential part of the curriculum is hands-on application of knowledge.[103] Merriam-Webster mentions that "polytechnic" is a word first used in 1801 derived from the French polytechnique which contains the Greek-roots "poly" (English:many) and "technē" (art). Thus, Merriam-Webster defines "polytechnic" as, "relating to or devoted to instruction in many technical arts or applied sciences".[104] Cal Poly Pomona's polytechnic approach, and learn-by-doing philosophy, encourages students in all programs to get real-world experience and skills necessary to join the workforce upon graduation.[105] In addition, the university is among six other institutions of higher education in California that have been designated a "Center of Academic Excellence" by the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency (NSA).[106][107] While all majors are encouraged to participate in co-op opportunities and internships, all students must do a senior research project.[108] The 300,000 sq ft (28,000 m2) Cal Poly Pomona University Library serves "as the central intellectual and cultural resource of the campus community" and contains 2.4 million items and serves as an important center for academic research.[109] Built in 1969 for $4.2 million, the library underwent a major renovation and expansion completed in the summer of 2008 at a cost of over $46 million.[110][111] The library participates in the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) Enhance program which allows it to correct or add information to bibliographic records in WorldCat.[112] Distinctions[edit] The university boasts many nationally acclaimed academic colleges and programs. With approximately 5,000 students, its college of Engineering is the second largest in the California State University system.[113] The university has the largest Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Construction Engineering programs in the CSU, and is the only campus to offer an Engineering Technology focus. Just behind Cal State Fullerton, the university has the second largest Business Administration major in the CSU with nearly 5,000 students. Its Hospitality program is the largest in the CSU and one of the largest in all of the US, with approximately 1,000 students enrolled. Overall, the university holds the fourth largest business college in the CSU.[113] Rankings[edit] Further information on college-specific rankings: Cal Poly Pomona academics § Rankings Academic rankings Regional U.S. News & World Report[114] 14 Master's University class Washington Monthly[115] 57 National Forbes[116] 273 THE/WSJ[117] 389 According to U.S. News & World Report's 2022 "Best Regional Universities West Rankings," Cal Poly Pomona is ranked 14nd in the western United States for regional public schools whose highest degree is a Master's, 3rd in Top Public Schools, 3rd for Most Innovative School, 6 in Best Undergraduate Teaching (tie), 7 in Top Performers on Social Mobility (tie) and 37 in Best Value School.

Requesting a change to an impacted majors must be received by the end of the initial filing period for the term for which new majors are being accepted (i.e. By February 28, 2010 for summer 2011; November 30, 2010 for fall 2011; June 30, 2011 for winter 2012; or August 31, 2011 for spring 2012).[151] Student life[edit] Student suites at Cal Poly Pomona Aliso Residence Hall Housing[edit] Cal Poly's Bronco Recreation and Intramural Complex (BRIC) With an on-campus housing capacity of 3,519 students, Cal Poly Pomona has the fifth largest housing system in the California State University.[152][153] In 2016, 39% of first-year students and 10% of all students live in college housing.[140] There are three residential styles on the Pomona campus. The oldest housing facilities consist of six residential halls, known as the Traditional Halls, located on University Drive. The four older red-brick halls are named Alamitos, Aliso, Encinitas, and Montecito, each providing accommodation for up to 212 residents. The other two housing halls (Cedritos and Palmitas), were the result of a 1968 development and each has room to accommodate up to 185 residents. These two halls were described as eligible for the California Historic Register as "a significant example of the work of highly noted Southern California architectural firm, Smith and Williams".[154][155][156][157][158][159] Newer residential complexes include the University Village and the Suites which offer apartment-style living to non-freshman students. The Residence Halls, Traditional Halls, and the Suites are managed by the Division of Student Affairs, whereas the University Village is managed by the Cal Poly Pomona Foundation.[160] Phase I of the construction of the Suites, housing 420 students, was completed in 2004 and Phase II, housing 622 students, opened in 2010.[159] In an effort to reduce commuting and raise academic performance and retention, starting with the 2010–2011 academic year, freshmen from outside the Tier 1 Local Admissions area (the area roughly bounded by the San Gabriel Mountains and Chino Hills to the north and south and the 15 and 605 freeways to the east and west), will be required to live on campus.[142] Currently, there have been ongoing efforts to grow the residential community on campus. In 2017, construction began on two new residential halls (Sicomoro and Secoya) along with a new dining hall (Centerpointe Dining Commons), which are intended to replace the aging and seismically unfit residential community along University Drive. The new Residence Halls opened to select first-year residents in January of 2020. The Residence Halls can house 980 residents and are only open to first-year students.[161][162] Students on a walkway leading to the CLA Building Bronco Student Center[edit] Main article: Bronco Student Center Bronco Student Center The Bronco Student Center is a student activity center for meetings, conferences, meals, recreation, and shopping for students and alumni on the campus of Cal Poly Pomona in Pomona, California.

They were composed mostly of homeless and orphaned boys of all races who were cared for at the Voorhis School during the ten-year period it operated.[170] Despite this historical background, the university's current athletic programs are named the Broncos. Cal Poly Pomona Broncos[edit] Cal Poly Pomona varsity teams compete in the California Collegiate Athletic Association of NCAA Division II. Teams are known as the Cal Poly Pomona Broncos and field 10 sports for men and women for the fall, winter, and spring quarters.
